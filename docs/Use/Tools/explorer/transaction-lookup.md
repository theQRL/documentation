A transaction can be looked up by providing the transaction hash to the [QRL Explorer](https://explorer.theqrl.org) search bar, or clicking on the *txhash* in a block or address lookup.

This lookup gives detailed information on the transaction and will vary depending on the type of transaction. 


:::info
A transaction hash is a hexadecimal string that is unique to that transaction. Example txhash -  *269f1f53a87dcaa87aa27ca6abf945109abf5d11cf28a6e3f9dae6bc73a2e606*

For a detailed list of transaction types and their usage see the [developer documentation](#)

## Transaction Information

Detailed transaction information is shown below for the transaction that was queried. This includes the type of transaction, sending QRL address, receiving QRL address and amount sent for a typical transfer.

The Large amount sent will also show a value in USD underneath, this is the current estimated value of the amount of QRL transferred, not the historical value at the time of transfer. 

Additional information is shown in the meta tab, this is the detailed information that has been simplified and presented in the page above. Most of the time there is no need to view this data, however there is no sensitive information contained within.
