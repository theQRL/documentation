The QRL mobile application allows for advanced configuration of the wallet generation parameters however for most users the default selections are sufficient. 


New addresses can be created in a few different ways using the mobile application. 


## New Install

If this is the first time opening the application you will be presented with 3 options:

- Create Default Wallet
- Create Advanced Wallet
- Open Existing Wallet

Select the default wallet option unless you have a specific need to modify the wallet generation parameters (*tree height, hash function*).

This will prompt you for a 4 digit pin code to secure the wallet with and a name for the wallet.

Once entered, select the create button and a new quantum secure address is created and available to use on your mobile device.

The PIN code entered will be needed anytime you need to access the wallet.

:::warning BACKUP YOUR ADDRESS
Be sure to save the secret keys to your new wallet in a safe and secure location, not on the mobile device. Without these keys the wallet cannot be recovered!

[Backup mobile wallet instructions can be found here.](/use/wallet/mobile/backup)
:::


## Add a New Wallet

You can have multiple wallet addresses on a single mobile device. In the menu, select the Wallets tab and look for the (+) plus sign to create a new wallet.

This will open the same menu as before allowing a default or advanced wallet creation as well as opening an address from secret keys.

Select the default wallet option to create a new address.

## Switch between wallets

To switch between wallets, select the **wallets** tab in the menu.

Select the wallet you wish to interact with and enter the pin code associated to that wallet. *This was setup when the wallet was created*. 

:::tip
The wallet icon on the left hand side will activate the pin code prompt.

This will switch to the selected wallet and show any balance information and allow transactions.
