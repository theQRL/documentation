In order to interact with a QRL wallet it must be opened using the private keys that were created during the [wallet creation](/use/wallet/web/new) process.

Browse to the QRL Web wallet at https://wallet.theqrl.org to get started opening a wallet.

## Private Keys

There are a few ways that the private keys for an address are represented. Any of these recovery methods will suffice to open a QRL address.

| Recovery Key Medium | Information |
| --- | --- |
| [Mnemonic Phrase](/build/address/mnemonic)  | <ul><li>Wordlist consisting of 34 selected words from the [master QRL wordlist](https://github.com/theQRL/qrllib/blob/master/src/qrl/wordlist.cpp)</li><li>Available using backup functions of the wallet applications</li> <li>Provided during most address generation steps</li></ul> |
| [Hexseed](developers/address/hexseed) | <ul><li>Available using backup functions of the wallet applications</li><li>Hexseed consisting of 102 mixed alpha numeric characters</li><li>Provided during most address generation processes, or found in a "Backup Wallet" function</li></ul> |
| [`wallet.json` file](developers/address/wallet-json) |  <ul><li>Contains both Hexseed and Mnemonic as well as the Public Key</li><li>May be encrypted *(recommended)* and passphrase will be required to open</li><li>Generated from the [Desktop](/use/wallet/desktop/overview), [Web](/use/wallet/web/overview) and [CLI](/use/node/cli) wallet applications</li></ul> |


:::warning Test your backups!
These keys allow full access to the address and all funds and assets that are held in that address. Ensure you secure them in an appropriate manner to protect the security of the funds.
