## Open QRL Wallet

By using the recovery method you have created, you can access your wallet to send or receive QRL.


Enter your information into the "Wallet Seed / File" field. Make sure the drop down on the right matches the data you chose (Mnemonic, Hexphrase, or wallet file).

Click "Unlock Wallet" and your QRL wallet will open allowing you to check balances and interact with the QRL network.
