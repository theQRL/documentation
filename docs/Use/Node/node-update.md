Running a QRL node requires maintenance from time to time. Follw these instructions to update.

## Updating

The overall process to updating a node is very simple.

1. Stop the running QRL node process
2. Update the QRL node `pip3 install -U qrl`
3. Restart the QRL Node `start_qrl`


### Stop the QRL Node

Before updating the node the process must be stopped. Below are some variations, depending on how the node is running.

  groupID="syntaxSelection"
  values={[
    { label: 'Screen Session', value: 'screen', },
    { label: 'Stop Systemd', value: 'systemd', },
    { label: 'Linux kill command', value: 'kill', },
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="screen">

#### QRL Node Running in `screen`

If you have previously started the QRL node in a `screen` session, enter the session and issue the `ctl +c` command to 
kill the process with the signal `SIGINT`

First find the screen session name with the `screen --list` command.

```bash {4}
$ screen --list

There are screens on:
  2933349.qrl-node  (01/22/2022 12:01:02 AM)  (Detached) 
```

Reattach to the named session.

```bash
$ screen -r qrl-node
```
This will put you in the active node process, enter `ctl +c` to stop the node

The node is stopped now, you can move on to updating.

<TabItem value="systemd">

#### QRL Node in Background with `systemd`

If the node has been setup to run in the background with linux systemd follow these steps to stop the node.

check for the running node process

Stop the running process using the `systemctl` tool

```bash 
systemctl stop qrl-node
```

Check that it is stopped with 

```bash
systemctl status qrl-node`
```

You can now update the node.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kill">

#### Linux `kill` Command

To stop the node, use the `kill {PID}` command where {PID} is replaced with the PID of the local process. 

`ps aux |grep start_qrl` shows the running QRL node process on the local machine.

```bash {4}
$ ps aux |grep start_qrl

USER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
fr1t2       8219  0.0  0.0   9856  2496 ?        Ss   Jan10   0:18 SCREEN -Sdm qrl-node start_qrl
```
Here the node is running in a `screen` session named `qrl-node` with PID of `8219` on this computer.

For this example the command to stop the node was `kill 8219`.

Ensure the process is gone with:

```bash
ps aux |grep start_qrl

fr1t2     9529  0.0  0.0  14864  1036 pts/0    S+   22:54   0:00 grep --color=auto start_qrl
```

You can now update the node.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Update the QRL Node Software

With the node stopped, issue the update command, which happens to be the same as the initial install command.

```bash
pip3 install -U qrl
```

This will pull in the latest release from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/qrl/) and update any needed dependencies.


Once complete, you can restart the node.

```bash
start_qrl
```

### State Migration

Any time there is a major update there will be a state migration the happens once you start the node.

> FIXME! What happens with state migration and when is it needed?
