The QRL foundation monitors and maintains multiple services related to the Quantum Resistant Ledger and it's functional operation. These services can be seen on the [QRL Service Status Dashboard](https://status.theqrl.org/).

This dashboard gives insight to critical services such as the Web Wallet, Block Explorer, and various QRL Nodes for these services. 

The https://status.theqrl.org/ page allows anyone to give an email address to be notified of any downtime or outages that may effect additional 3rd party services and user interaction with the chain.

Look for a button with a bell in the top right corner of the status page. Submit your email address and the system will notify as soon as something goes down.

If you notice the status is down on a service, please notify the project support@theqrl.org
