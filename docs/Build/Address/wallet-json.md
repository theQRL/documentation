A wallet.json file is an amalgamation of all of the wallet information. This file contains every bit of information for an address including the full seed (_pk_), hexseed, mnemonic phrase, public address, as well as various information on how the address was generated.



:::warning Never share this file!
The wallet.json file should be stored encrypted, and should never be shared. It allows full access to any funds contained in the wallet address.
::: 

:::note Example wallet.json file
Below is an example of the wallet.json file contents stored insecurely without encryption for ease of viewing here.


```json
[
  { 
    "address":"Q000400202ea4dc2b83ded8cfcd4fc8c0447ca3391582430cec6b093291ab9773173af1bb5ed7e8",

```

A wallet.json file can be uploaded to the wallet software encrypted or unsecured, and will allow the wallet software to re-generate the full Merkle tree for the given address. This will allow full interaction with the blockchain and access to all funds contained in the wallet.
