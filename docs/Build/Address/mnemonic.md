A mnemonic phrase is a list of words that cryptographically represent the seed when compared to a given word list and passed through an algorithm. 


Depending on where these words are in the list assigns a unique number to each word. When passed through an algorithm they produce the same SEED used to generate a XMSS tree. 

The Mnemonic is a user friendly way to represent the hexseed and is less error prone than a hexseed when a user is presented with backing up and storing key information.
