# Qryptonight

*WARNING: This is work in progress, changes might not be backward compatible.*

This library (derived from xmr-stak) currently exposes the following functionality:  

- Python Wrapper for Cryptonight hash
- Mining thread and hybrid callback

## Installing

#### Ubuntu
```
sudo apt -y install swig3.0 python3-dev build-essential cmake libhwloc-dev libboost-dev
pip3 install pyqryptonight
````

#### OSX

If you dont have brew yet, we think you should :) Install brew following the instructions here: [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)

Now install some dependencies

```bash
brew install cmake python3 swig hwloc boost
pip3 install pyqryptonight
```

#### Windows
```
TBD
```

## Building from Source

#### Windows
For the purposes of these instructions Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017, CMake 3.10.2, Ninja 1.8.2, Python 3.6 and SWIG 3.0.12 were used, also ```c:\src``` was used for source files and ```c:\opt``` for other dependencies, adjust accordingly if choosing differently.

Note: You can use Microsoft MSBuild instead of Ninja Build by setting environment variable ```CMAKE_VS_GENERATOR=Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64```, however if you choose to install the pyqryptonight package Python setuptools currently will not install it correctly.

Prerequisites:
- Install [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017) selecting the *'Visual C++ build tools'* option, or install [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) selecting the *'Desktop Development for C++ workload'*.
- Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) keeping the default option to use git from the command prompt.
- Install the latest stable [CMake x64 for Windows](https://cmake.org/download/), selecting to add CMake to system or user PATH.
- Install [Python 3 Windows x86-64](https://www.python.org/downloads/) selecting the option to '*Add Python 3.x to PATH*'. Optionally change the install location to ```c:\python36```, install the debugging symbols/binaries, and disable the path length limit.
- Download [SWIG](http://swig.org/) *(download swigwin)* and extract archive to ```c:\opt```
- Download [Ninja Build](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases) and extract ```ninja.exe``` to ```c:\opt\bin```

*Install vcpkg:*
- From the start menu run the *'x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017'* and issue these commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git c:\opt\vcpkg
cd c:\opt\vcpkg
bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
vcpkg.exe install hwloc:x64-windows boost-multiprecision:x64-windows
```

*Build Qrytonight:*
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/theQRL/qryptonight.git c:\src\qryptonight
cd \src\qryptonight
set PATH=c:\opt\bin;c:\opt\swigwin-3.0.12;%PATH%
set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:/opt/vcpkg/installed/x64-windows
set CC=cl.exe
set CXX=cl.exe

python setup.py build
```

If the build succeeded you can perform further steps, issue the command ```python setup.py --help-commands``` to see other options, e.g.:
```
python setup.py test
python setup.py install
```
