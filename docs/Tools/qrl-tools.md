The QRL Foundation has funded development of multiple tools to increase the value and usability of the Quantum Resistant Ledger beyond the quantum resistant blockchain and ledger. 

These tools vary from [On-Chain Notarization](/tools/notarise/) to [multi-signature addresses](/tools/multisig) allowing a wide range of custodial transaction options.

These docs cover the various tools available to the project, most are access through the QRL Wallet Application. You can find this in the **Tools** tab using the [Web Wallet](wallet/web) or [desktop wallet](wallet/desktop) application.
