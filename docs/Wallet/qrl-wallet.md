The Quantum Resistant Ledger's wallet functions similar to other cryptocurrencies in which there are both public and private keys that represent an address. Where the QRL wallet differs from most, and where the post quantum security derives, is the signature scheme used.

The QRL uses [eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme *(XMSS)*](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/484), a hash based cryptography that's been around since the 70's and recently [approved for use in cryptographic systems by NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-208/final). 

XMSS is considered to be one of the most secure quantum resistant algorithms in use today. There is one drawback to hash based cryptography however, a signature key may only be used one time.

:::info **OTS** *(One Time Signature Keys)*
OTS keys can only be used to sign one transaction. There are limited keys for an address depending on tree height selected during address creation. 
See the [OTS Documentation](ots-keys) for more information.

## QRL Wallet Applications

The QRL Foundation provides a multitude of wallet applications including support for the Ledger Nano through the desktop application.

### QRL Web Wallet

This is the QRL Web wallet developed by The QRL team, hosted at [https://wallet.theqrl.org](https://wallet.theqrl.org).

:::note Web Wallet Docs
Check out the [Web Wallet documentation](Wallet/Web/web-wallet) for detailed usage and more information.
:::


- Built securely using [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)
- All secure XMSS operations are run in a web assembly compiled version of [qrllib](https://github.com/theQRL/qrllib) locally in your browser
- Keys stay in the memory space of the XMSS object, which is destroyed the moment you close the wallet, browser window
- Code is all open source and can be found at https://github.com/theqrl/

## QRL Wallet Keys

A QRL wallet is made up of a key pair, from which the Merkle tree of OTS keys are generated. These OTS keys are used to sign transactions, never exposing the root secret private key. 

These public and private keys can be stored in a wallet file, mnemonic, or hex-phrase and are utilized through a wallet application. 

:::note
For more information on QRL's cryptography see the [Address Scheme](#),  
:::

### Public Keys

At the base of the wallet is the QRL address. The public key starts with a `Q` and consists of 79 hexadecimal characters.

The Public address represents the account and is what would be given to receive funds into the account.

#### Example QRL Public Address

```
Q010500cf8971ae2f24cecc4296a23c24277bd107dbbc630bc0799dca65f9c25449d781148b7a85
```

:::info QRL PUBLIC KEY
Public keys are safe to share with trusted parties you will be transacting with. Use this to request funds from another user or to deposit funds yourself. 
:::

### Private Keys

A private key is required to interact with the QRL blockchain. This key is used to sign a transaction, verifying it originated using this key.Anyone with this key can send transactions on behalf of the address.

The private keys can be represented in either a hexseed or a mnemonic phrase. Either can be used to restore a wallet and best practice should be followed to ensure the security of these keys.


:::danger Never Share Private Wallet Keys
These keys should never be shared! Anyone can transfer funds using a secret key. 
:::

Private keys can not be recovered or regenerated if lost. Without them, any funds in the address will not be recoverable. Backup address keys and store in safe locations.

#### Example QRL Mnemonic

This list of 34 works represents the same key as the hexseed, with each word corresponding to an index location in the [QRL wordlist](https://github.com/theQRL/qrllib/blob/master/src/qrl/wordlist.cpp). This list is converted into binary/hexadecimal representation of the private keys.
