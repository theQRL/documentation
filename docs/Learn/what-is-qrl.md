An externally audited enterprise-grade blockchain platform secure today from the quantum computing advances of tomorrow. The QRL is a visionary blockchain and digital asset security


## The QRL Mission

Provide enterprise grade security to the blockchain space with the future quantum threat in mind. Instead of relying on the classical secure elliptical curve cryptography to secure signatures The QRL has deployed XMSS, a NIST-approved post-quantum secure digital signature scheme.

By utilizing this post-quantum secure signature scheme from genesis, we are able to provide advanced asset protection now, as well as the future.

### Quantum Resistance

To understand what the difference between classical computers and quantum computers, lets start with the problem and current solution.


#### Classical Resistance


Finding complex prime numbers for a classical computer proves to be more difficult than one would think. This process is iterative and due to the massive number space mostly impractical for a classical computer to try and guess. 

Using this foundation, cryptographers devised methods to secure data with a "difficult to guess" prime numbers represented by an elliptical curve. Guessing this prime number without secret data is impractical and requires a sufficient classical computer running for a long time. 

This is what cryptographers call **classically secure**, or secure against the attack by a sufficient classical computer.
