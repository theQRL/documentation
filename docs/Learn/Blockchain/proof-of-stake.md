Blockchain proof-of-stake (POS) is a type of consensus algorithm that is used to achieve distributed consensus in a blockchain network. 

In a proof-of-stake system, the creator of the next block on the chain is chosen based on their stake, or how many coins they hold, in the network. 

This is in contrast to proof-of-work (POW) systems, where the creator of the next block is chosen based on their computational power.

There are several advantages to using proof-of-stake (POS) consensus over proof-of-work (POW). 

One of the main advantages is that POS systems are generally more energy-efficient than POW systems. 

This is because in a POW system, miners need to use a significant amount of computational power to solve complex mathematical problems in order to create new blocks, which consumes a lot of energy. 

In a POS system, on the other hand, the creator of the next block is chosen based on their stake in the network, so the process of creating new blocks is less resource-intensive.
